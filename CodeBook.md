Code Book
==========

## Overview

This code book will describe the data used in this project, as well as the processing required to create the resulting tidy data set.
30 volunteers performed 6 different activities while wearing a smartphone. The smartphone captured various data about their movements.

## Prerequisite

This script loads the data from your working directory in `UCI HAR Dataset` folder. (If not, please download and unzip the file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip manually)

## Input data

* `features.txt`: Names of the 561 features.
* `activity_labels.txt`: Names and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

* `X_train.txt`: 7352 observations of the 561 features, for 21 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.
* `y_train.txt`: A vector of 7352 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_train.txt`.

* `X_test.txt`: 2947 observations of the 561 features, for 9 of the 30 volunteers.
* `subject_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the volunteer related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.
* `y_test.txt`: A vector of 2947 integers, denoting the ID of the activity related to each of the observations in `X_test.txt`.

More information about the files is available in `README.txt`. More information about the features is available in `features_info.txt`.

## Steps to process data

1. All of the input data files were read into data frames, necessary column headers were added, as a result training and test sets were combined into a single data set.
2. Defining relevant feature columns "mean()" or "std()".
3. A tidy data set was created containing the mean of each feature for each subject and each activity. 
4. The tidy data set was output to a CSV file `tidy_data.csv`

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
